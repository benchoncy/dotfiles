# benchoncy's dotfiles

These dotfiles are managed using [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi). This tool allows for this repository to not only manage dotfiles but also other aspects of my home directory with templating, externals and more. This saves me time on setup and covers tasks I would otherwise need to do using another tool.

This configuration is intended to be relatively minimalist while also providing my desired functionality.
